    <p>VS Code is the text editor I am using</p>
    <p>Chapter 1 provides an overview of webpage design and all of the design elements that must be taken into consideration when creating a webpage. Before you begin coding a website, you must first create a wireframe and site map. Next, you need to consider several design elements, such as graphics, navigation, and color. Finally, you must also plan for accessibility.</p>
    <p>After reading Chapter 1, I now understand how to download and use a text editor to create an HTML page. I know whichHTML elements are required to create a basic HTML.</p>
