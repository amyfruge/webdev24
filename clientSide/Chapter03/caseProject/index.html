        <p>FNAF stands for "Five Nights at Freddy's," which is a popular 
            indie horror video game franchise created by Scott Cawthon. 
            
            In the game, players typically take on the role of a night 
            security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a fictional family 
            restaurant similar to Chuck E. Cheese's. The gameplay involves 
            surviving five nights (and often additional nights) by 
            monitoring security cameras and closing security doors to 
            defend against animatronic characters that come to life at 
            night and may attack the player.

            The series gained widespread popularity due to its unique blend 
            of horror, suspense, and gameplay mechanics, as well as its 
            intriguing lore and backstory, which are gradually revealed 
            through clues and hidden messages throughout the games. 
            
            FNAF has spawned numerous sequels, spin-offs, merchandise, and a 
            devoted fanbase.</p>
