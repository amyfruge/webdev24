                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>To use the sticky position, apply the CSS property "position: sticky;" to the element you want to stick. 
                    You can also specify the direction of stickiness using properties like top, bottom, left, or right, 
                    depending on where you want the element to stick relative to its containing element or the viewport.</p>

            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>The "position: relative;" property was used for the relative box, with values of "top: 50px;" and "left: 20px;". 
                    These values shifted the box 50 pixels down and 20 pixels to the right from its normal position in the page.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
            
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>The "position: fixed;" property was used for the fixed box, with values of "top: 70px;" and "right: 40px;". 
                    These values positioned the box 50 pixels from the top of the viewport and 20 pixels from the right side of the viewport.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>The "position: absolute;" property was used for the absolute box, with values of "bottom: 20px;" and "right: 10px;". 
                    These values positioned the box 20 pixels from the bottom of its containing element and 10 pixels from the right side of its containing element.</p>
